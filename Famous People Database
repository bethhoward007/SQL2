#For this project I chose my favorite musicians.

#Then I created a table to show personal facts about the artists.

CREATE TABLE famous_people (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
home_town TEXT,
birth_date TEXT,
genre TEXT);

#Then I performed analytics on the data using SQL

#I inserted the data into the table using the following SQL.

INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (1,"SZA","Missouri", 11/08/1989,"R&B");
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (2,"Post Malone","Texas",7/04/1995,"Hiphop/Rap");
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (3,"Jordan Ward","Missouri", 03/26/1996, "R&B");
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (4,"Drake","Toronto",11/24/1986,"Hiphop/Rap/R&B");
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (5,"Lizzo","Michigan",04/27/1988,"Pop");


#I created another table showing recent albums from the artists.


CREATE TABLE recent_albums(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name_id INTEGER,
title TEXT);

INSERT INTO recent_albums VALUES (1,1,"SOS");
INSERT INTO recent_albums VALUES (2,2,"AUSTIN");
INSERT INTO recent_albums VALUES (3,3,"FORWARD");
INSERT INTO recent_albums VALUES (4,4,"Her Loss");
INSERT INTO recent_albums VALUES (5,5,"Special");


#Created one more table about the tours and the price range of tickets for each artists.

CREATE TABLE tours(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
lowest_price TEXT,
highest_price TEXT);

INSERT INTO tours VALUES(1,84,1450);
INSERT INTO tours VALUES(2,108,2100);
INSERT INTO tours VALUES(3,29.50,60);
INSERT INTO tours VALUES(4,360,3500);
INSERT INTO tours VALUES(5,95,1675);

#Next explored the data usig the following SQL.

SELECT famous_people.name,recent_albums.name_id
FROM famous_people
JOIN recent_albums
ON famous_people.id= recent_albums.name_id;

SELECT title FROM recent_albums
LEFT OUTER JOIN famous_people
ON recent_albums.id = famous_people.name;

SELECT home_town 
FROM famous_people 
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY name;
